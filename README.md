Exercise: Create Hashtags
  
In the attached documents, find the most important words  across the enclosed sample documents, and the sentences where they are used to create the following table:
 
![](/sample.png)
--- 
--- 
--- 
  
This is an example, you have the flexibility to modify the final output display as per your wish.
The idea behind it is to build a reusable solution which can be extended to other documents and text sources.  
  
# python scratch_1.py doc1.txt doc2.txt doc3.txt doc4.txt doc5.txt doc6.txt n
(where n = number of top words)
