# Eigen tech Exercise
Exercise: Create Hashtags
  
In the attached documents, find the most important words  across the enclosed sample documents, and the sentences where they are used to create the following table:
 
![](/sample.png)
--- 
--- 
--- 
  
This is an example, you have the flexibility to modify the final output display as per your wish.
The idea behind it is to build a reusable solution which can be extended to other documents and text sources.
This is an opportunity to display your engineering flair.  We highly encourage you to showcase your engineering ability rather than only fulfilling the requirements of the task.  The more experience you have, the more we expect to be impressed.  But most of all, enjoy the exercise!
  
We work in Python and prefer that the back-end code in your test be done in Python. If you would like to submit in another language instead, please let us know and weâ€™re happy to discuss. Regardless, please provide an explanation of how to run your code and any additional files, list of requirements, etc., necessary to build and/or run it.
 
When you are happy that your work is complete, please return it to us in compressed format, such that we can extract it and run to see the intended results.
