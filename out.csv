country,"it's humbling, but in my heart i know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
and we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.
for that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.
and let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.
politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
all of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.
it is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
we are a better country than this.
this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.
this country is more generous than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to china, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
because next week, in minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third.
and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
the republican nominee, john mccain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
you see, we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight.
in the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, i think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
and we will keep our promise to every young american - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.
so don't tell me that democrats won't defend this country.
i love this country, and so do you, and so does john mccain.
we all put our country first.
we may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
this country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
it's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
he was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the democrats should come down to just two words:

had enough?
i've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
and i've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
i think he loves his country.
the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
and so i am eager to have this argument not just with the president, but the entire republican party over what this country is about.
will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country?
we are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say ""yes"" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
his ideas about how kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
we know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.
as a senator from the united states, i believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with kenya and with africa.
you enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
i know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of kenyans still live in poverty.
and i know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.
today, we're starting to see that the kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
i don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.
when people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
by rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.
by focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.
and you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger kenya where everyone rises together.
since that time i have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those i heard from my relatives here in kenya on my last trip to this country.
that policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country.
these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?
a year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan iraq study group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.
for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country.
the first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
according to a pew survey, 42% of americans now agree with the statement that the u.s. should ""mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.‚Äù

we cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
it is time to give iraqis their country back.","doc1.txt,doc2.txt,doc3.txt,doc4.txt,doc5.txt"
government,"i saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
the genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.
the cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.
they write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.
and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
these challenges are not all of government's making.
we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes.
ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
our government should work for us, not against us.
yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
but we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
i've seen it in washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
that even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
in a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
the sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
but while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
the reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
we know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
the party that won't make americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.
and let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
like many nations across this continent, where kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
in the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
in a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.
and we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
so if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
an accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.
dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ?
that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure iraq.
when possible, this should be done in consultation with the iraqi government ?
instead of consolidating the gains made by the karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.
we can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
and that is the loss of our government‚Äôs credibility with the american people.
and the kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in ukraine, dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the cooperative threat reduction program.
while the government of ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.","doc1.txt,doc2.txt,doc3.txt,doc4.txt,doc5.txt,doc6.txt"
iraq,"and when all else fails, when katrina happens, or the death toll in iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq.
because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from iraq and afghanistan, i see my grandfather, who signed up after pearl harbor, marched in patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the gi bill.
for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11, i stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
you don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq.
i will end this war in iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan.
we've seen our children leave for iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11.
that if you say the words ""plan for victory"" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at dover air force base.
a few tuesdays ago, the american people embraced this seriousness with regards to america‚Äôs policy in iraq.
iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.
and a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al qaeda is successfully using the war in iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on america.
these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?
this kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002. the notion that iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the middle east was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
last week, without a trace of irony, the president even chose vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling ‚Äúpatience‚Äù with his policies in iraq.
at that point, seventy-five u.s. senators, republican and democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in iraq.
a year in which well-respected republicans like john warner, former administration officials like colin powell, generals who have served in iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
a year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan iraq study group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
‚Äúrejected the notion of an american ‚Äòtimeline‚Äô for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.‚Äù

this is now the reality of iraq.
now, i am hopeful that the iraq study group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.
and so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in iraq.
rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
what is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the president to respond to iraq‚Äôs reality by saying that he is ‚Äúopen to‚Äù or ‚Äúinterested in‚Äù new ideas while acting as if all that‚Äôs required is doing more of the same.
it may be politically advantageous for the president to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in iraq.
namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
there is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in iraq.
the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
they have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in iraq.
i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.
to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.
that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure iraq.
the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
the president‚Äôs decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato‚Äôs call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.
we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.
any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq.
in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.
the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
so far, congress has given the administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in iraq.
finally, we have to realize that the entire middle east has an enormous stake in the outcome of iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america‚Äôs strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.
threats we haven‚Äôt paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq.
the national intelligence estimate, which details how we‚Äôre creating more terrorists in iraq than we‚Äôre defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ?
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?

i know i haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington.
each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
the time for that politics is over.
it's time to turn the page.
america, it's time to start bringing our troops home.
it's time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
it will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
and if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as i see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as i sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then i'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.
i am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the amtrak train he still takes home every night.
but the record's clear: john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time.
senator mccain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
well it's time for them to own their failure.
it's time for us to change america.
in that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.
now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
america, now is not the time for small plans.
now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy.
now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single american.
now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.
and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.

my friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in america's history.
it's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country.
that she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was.

the time for our party's identity crisis is over.

our time to make a mark on history.
our time to write a new chapter in the american story.
our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up.
and then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when america renewed its purpose.
they can say that this was the time when america found its way.
they can say that this was the time when america learned to dream again.
the first time i came to kenya was in 1987. i had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.

they fight the fight of our time.
since that time i have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those i heard from my relatives here in kenya on my last trip to this country.
it‚Äôs not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own.
in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.
but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
it‚Äôs time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.

it is time to change our policy.
it is time to give iraqis their country back.
and it is time to refocus america‚Äôs efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
but this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.

war,"in the face of war, you believe there can be peace.
all of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
for the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq.
most of you know i opposed this war from the start.
it's time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.
finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
we meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the american promise has been threatened once more.
for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9/11, i stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
and today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration, even after we learned that iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
i will end this war in iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan.
whether it's the war or katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change.
i've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a great depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
in a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
and when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the american people about why we are there and how we will win.
but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
it can shield a war criminal - even one like felicien kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.
americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
2,867 americans have now died in this war.
and a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al qaeda is successfully using the war in iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on america.
this kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002. the notion that iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the middle east was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
i said then and believe now that saddam hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
month after month, and then year after year, i‚Äôve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war‚Äôs conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.
and i believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.
for the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.
and, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
but even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
the president‚Äôs decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
this must end in the next session of congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.
the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.
many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.
the second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
the national intelligence estimate, which details how we‚Äôre creating more terrorists in iraq than we‚Äôre defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.
throughout the cold war, the soviet union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.","doc1.txt,doc2.txt,doc3.txt,doc4.txt,doc5.txt,doc6.txt"
